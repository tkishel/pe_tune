## Description

This module provides a `puppet infrastructure tune` command that outputs optimized settings for Puppet Enterprise services based upon hardware resources. See DESIGN.md for more information.

## Setup

Install this module on the Primary Master:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tkishel/pe_tune.git /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/pe_tune
puppet agent -t
```

Or, install this module (on the Primary Master) as a standalone script:

```shell
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tkishel/pe_tune/master/lib/puppet_x/puppetlabs/tune.rb
chmod +x tune.rb
```

## Usage

1. Run `puppet infrastructure tune` (or `./tune.rb`) on the Primary Master.
1. Verify the settings.
1. Add the settings to Hiera.
1. Remove duplicate settings from the Console.
1. Run `puppet agent -t` on each Puppet Enterprise infrastructure host to apply the settings.

#### Parameters

##### `--hiera DIRECTORY`

When specified, settings are redirected to YAML files in that directory.

For example:

```
[root@split-master ~]# puppet infrastructure tune --hiera /tmp/nodes
### Puppet Infrastructure Summary: Found a Split Infrastructure

## Found: 16 Core(s) / 32768 MB RAM for Primary Master split-master.puppetdebug.vlan
## Wrote Hiera YAML to /tmp/nodes/split-master.puppetdebug.vlan.yaml

## Found: 4 Core(s) / 8192 MB RAM for Console Host split-console.puppetdebug.vlan
## Wrote Hiera YAML to /tmp/nodes/split-console.puppetdebug.vlan.yaml

## Found: 8 Core(s) / 16384 MB RAM for PuppetDB Host split-db.puppetdebug.vlan
## Wrote Hiera YAML to /tmp/nodes/split-db.puppetdebug.vlan.yaml
```

##### `--force`

When specified, do not enforce minimum system requirements (4 Cores, 8 GB RAM) for infrastructure hosts.

## Reference

This command reads infrastructure settings on the Primary Master, queries PuppetDB for node group membership to identify infrastructure hosts, queries PuppetDB for processor and memory facts for each infrastructure host, and outputs optimizing settings for each infrastructure host as Hiera YAML data.

### Output

By default, settings are output to STDOUT.

For example:

```shell
[root@master ~] puppet infrastructure tune
### Puppet Infrastructure Summary: Found a Monolithic Infrastructure

## Found: 8 Core(s) / 16384 MB RAM for Primary Master master.puppetdebug.vlan
## Specify the following in Hiera in nodes/master.puppetdebug.vlan.yaml

```

This module outputs node-specific settings. With a monolithic infrastructure, the output could be saved to common.yaml. With a split infrastructure, the output would need to be saved in node-specific YAML files included in a node-specific hierarchy.

For example:

#### Hiera 3.x

```yaml
---
:hierarchy:
  - "nodes/%{trusted.certname}"
```

#### Hiera 5.x

```yaml
---
version: 5
hierarchy:
  - name: "Per-Node Data"
    path: "nodes/%{trusted.certname}.yaml"
```
